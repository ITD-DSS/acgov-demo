                <p>Alameda County is seeking increased business community participation and philanthropic investments
                    to support child care facilities expansion and improvement for children in the County's
                    approximately 59,600 child care spaces. Although long acknowledged for providing children with
                    early learning opportunities, the child care industry also plays a dual role in supporting the
                    economy. </p>

                <p>In 1999, the Alameda County child care industry generated approximately $330 million in revenue, and
                    13,000 jobs, enabling parents to work or attend school. Links to resources are listed below to
                    assist with employer child care program development. Read on for more information about how your
                    business can support quality child care for your employees and the community. </p>

                <p> For more information on contributing to the Child Care Fund for child care facilities, or other
                    partnership opportunities, please contact Ellen Dektar, Senior Management Analyst, 510-208-9578 or
