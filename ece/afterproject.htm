        <h1>School-Age/Afterschool Care Workgroup</h1>
		
        <p><b>Introduction:</b> This is a committee that works collaboratively to address the various components of school age/after-school programs to affect public policy and practices. The Workgroup generally meets monthly in Berkeley and focuses on improvements in after-school program policies, connecting after-school program providers with each other as well as technical assistance resources. The Workgroup also supports Lights On! Afterschool, the national public awareness and advocacy effort designed to emphasize the importance of keeping the lights on and doors open for afterschool programs.</p>

        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bridging the Worlds of Afterschool Care.  This popular event, targeted to School Age Program Managers, has been held twice and attracted a diverse group from across the County to learn more about the various programs that serve school age children.</li>
            <li>&quot;Lights On Afterschool&quot;: Lights On Afterschool! is the only nationwide event calling attention to afterschool programs and their important role in the lives of children, families and communities. Lights On Afterschool! will rally community support for afterschool by shining the spotlight on programs at over 5,000 sites across the country. Parents, community and business leaders, elected officials, and the media will have an opportunity to see firsthand the benefits afterschool programs provide.</li>
            <li>Exemplary Practices: The Committee has adopted 12 Exemplary Practices designed to accelerate the movement of programs along a continuum from promising to exemplary and serves as a reflection opportunity for program leaders and key staff to assess where they believe their program is, developmentally, in each of the designated areas. Please click <a href="../ece/twelve.htm">here</a> for to view the 12 Exemplary Practices.</li>
            <li>Matrix: In 2003, we developed a matrix of various afterschool funding sources. This is a dynamic document and not very current!
