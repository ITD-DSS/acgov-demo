        <h1>Early Childhood Mental Health Systems Group</h1>
		
        <p><b>Introduction:</b> On behalf of our infants and young children, the Alameda County Early Childhood Mental Health Systems Group  will advocate for, develop and facilitate the implementation of a community-based, county-wide system of preventive mental health and treatment services for all young children and their families (prenatal to five) within the home, child care and the community. </p>
		
		<p>This group is comprised of the Policy Collaborative and the Community Services Collaborative.  The goal of the Early Childhood Mental Health Policy Collaborative is to promote systems change in the field of ECMH by working with policy makers and decision makers. The goal of the Community Services Collaborative is to create a consistent and open forum for a partnership between various levels of direct service providers and administrators in early childhood education, mental health, related training programs and other community service agencies. </p>
		
		<p>For the Early Childhood Mental Health Policy Collaborative, please contact Sue Greenwald at sue.greenwald@acgov.org or at (510) 875-2422. For the Community Services Collaborative, please contact Margie Gutierrez-Padilla at Padilla@bhcs.mail.co.alameda.ca.us or at (510) 777-2103.</p>
