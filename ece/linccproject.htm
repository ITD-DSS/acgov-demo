        <h1>LINCC Alameda County</h1>
		
        <p><b>Background and Introduction:</b> In 1997, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation awarded a grant to the National Economic Development and Law Center (NEDLC) to support the Local Investment in Child Care (LINCC) demonstration project through 2003. LINCC’s long term goal is to increase the capacity and sustainability of quality child care with an emphasis on preservation and renovation of existing child care facilities and development of new facilities.  The central strategies to achieve this are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Influence land use policy to encourage child care facilities development</li>
            <li>Integrate child care interests into economic development</li>
            <li>Support child care facilities development and improvement</li>
            <li>Enhance the business skills of child care providers.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Four counties began the project in 1997: Monterey, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, and Kern. Three additional counties joined LINCC in 1998: Santa Clara, San Benito, and Alameda. Los Angeles and Ventura received funding from their county governments. Up to 2000, NEDLC served as the intermediary organization incubating the project, providing technical assistance to county LINCC partners, convening peer learning meetings, and working on replicating the LINCC model.</p>
        <p>LINCC has an expanded section on this website, summarized in the following links:</p>

        <h2>LINCC Alameda County</h2>
        <p>Since joining the statewide LINCC Project in 1998, the Alameda County LINCC Project has worked with local child care resource and referral agencies to build a solid foundation for the expansion and improvement of child care facilities in Alameda County. The Alameda County General Services Agency serves as the “host” agency for the LINCC initiative.  The first step of the LINCC project was to produce a comprehensive report, “The Economic Impact of Child Care in Alameda County.” The LINCC Project uses this data to demonstrate to local leaders from a variety of sectors and levels of government how the child care industry contributes to the economic growth and vitality of the County. The LINCC Project then engages those leaders in planning and implementing actions that incorporate child care into every aspect of economic development. The Alameda County LINCC Project has helped the County become a statewide leader in local child care policy and planning.  Among its many significant accomplishments is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conceptualizing and coordinating the launch of the Child Care Fund which offers financial resources and business training to child care providers and is now housed at First Five/the Alameda County Children and Families Commission.</li>
            <li>Proposing and helping secure child care provisions in six city general plans,</li>
            <li>Hosting a child care forum for business in South County which recognized both business and local governments for their contributions to child care.</li>
            <li>Conducting two analyses of local jurisdictions’ land use permitting practices for child care, and engaging in public education and outreach with city planners and elected officials in collaboration with the Alameda County Children and Families Commission and other local child care organizations including the child care resource and referral agencies to capitalize on local opportunities to include child care in other land use and transportation projects.</li>
            <li>Calculating the economic impact of child care in Alameda County at the County and City level and developing and disseminating other outreach materials for local government and business on child care infrastructure improvement strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>LINCC Alameda County Projects:</h2>
        <p>Since its inception in April 1998, the Alameda County LINCC Project has embarked on a variety of initiatives related to enhancing and improving the child care sector’s role and standing in the economic development arena. Currently the Project focuses on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzing, reducing and/or removing land use barriers to child care facility development for child care through working with the child care field, developers, public agency staff and elected officials</li>
            <li>Including child care in local economic and transportation planning and development</li>
            <li>Increasing public and private resources for facilities development.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h2>LINCC Alameda County Evaluation and Future</h2>
        <p><b>Evaluation:</b> In January, 2002, The Packard Foundation contracted with SRI International (SRI) to evaluate the degree to which the LINCC communities had implemented the initiative’s strategies and produced the intended outcomes.[1]</p>
        <p>The evaluation found that among the major accomplishments of the entire initiative (which includes Santa Cruz, Kern, Monterey, San Mateo, Alameda, Santa Clara, Ventura (unfunded) and Los Angeles (unfunded)), LINCC accomplished its major goals and was successful.  LINCC:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessed $1.93 in local dollars for every $1 the Packard Foundation provided</li>
            <li>Established significant new funding mechanisms for planning and constructing child care facilities and expanding and renovating current centers and family child care homes</li>
            <li>Brought child care considerations into city and county economic planning</li>
            <li>Created an infrastructure of agencies and advocates to support child care facilities and business needs</li>
            <li>Educated substantial numbers of child care providers in business aspects of operating child care centers and homes</li>
            <li>Succeeded in changing some city and county policies regarding child care which may lead to new child care facilities in the future, depending on how the plans and policies are implemented</li>
        </ul>
         
        <p><b>Future:</b> LINCC project staff continue to solidify and systematize the child care technical assistance system available to developers and local planners, develop tools for the child care field to monitor and pursue opportunities to integrate child care into major land use and transportation planning, and work with local jurisdictions to recognize the critical role of child care in supporting their local economies through incorporating it in child care planning and financing.</p>
        <p>LINCC’s work will be done when housing developers and transportation planners automatically assess and plan for child care needs, when municipalities automatically reduce or eliminate fees and set incentives to develop child care facilities, and when communities automatically plan for child care facilities the way they do now for roads and schools.</p>
