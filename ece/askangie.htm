                <h2 id="1">I am looking for child care for my child. What types of child care options are available?</h2>
                <p>There are many different types of settings where your child may receive quality care and education.</p>

                <h3>Child Care Centers</h3>
                <p>Child care centers offer education and care for infants, toddlers and preschool-age (2-5 years), and
                    school-age (5-12 years) children in a group setting. Child care centers may provide a full (usually
                    between 7:00 am and 6:00 pm) or partial day (for example, between 9:00 am and 12:30 pm) program and
                    children are generally grouped according to age or ability. Sometimes preschool or nursery school
                    is used to refer to an early childhood program for groups of children generally beginning at 2 �
                    years old.</p>
                <p>All child care centers in Alameda County are required by law to be licensed by the <a href="http://ccld.ca.gov"
                        onclick="NewWindowStnd(this.href,'doc','center');return false" onfocus="this.blur()">California
                        Department of Social Services/Community Care Licensing Division</a>. Community Care Licensing
                    is responsible for enforcing minimum standards contained in Title 22, California Code of
                    Regulations. Regulations for centers cover staff qualifications and ratios, building and
                    playgrounds, health and safety standards, food services and many other aspects for operating.
                    Parents are encouraged to check on the licensing status of a particular family child care home by
                    calling Community Care Licensing at (510) 622-2602 or by going to the <a href="http://ccld.ca.gov/PG411.htm"
                        onclick="NewWindowStnd(this.href,'doc','center');return false" onfocus="this.blur()">Community
                        Care Licensing Division</a> website. </p>
                <p>Child care centers may be exempt from licensing by the California Department of Social
                    Services/Community Care Licensing Division if the centers fall within Title 22, article 2, section
                    101158 of the child care licensing regulations. An example of a center that is exempted from
                    licensing is: 1) any public recreation program that operates less than 16 hours per week and/or
                    operates for a total of 12 weeks or less during a 12-month period. This total applies to any 12
                    weeks within any 12-month period, without regard to whether the weeks are consecutive; 2) a program
                    provided to children under the age of four years and nine months with sessions that run 12 hours
                    per week or less and are 12 weeks or less in duration. A program may permit children to be enrolled
                    in consecutive sessions throughout the year. However, the program shall not permit children to be
                    enrolled in a combination of sessions that total more than 12 hours per week for each session.</p>
                <p>Child care centers may be accredited through various associations such as the National Association
                    for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), or the National AfterSchool Association (NAA).
                    Accreditation is a voluntary process designed to evaluate and improve the quality of child care by
                    meeting and maintaining national standards established by early childhood development
                    professionals.</p>

                    <h3>Family Child Care Homes</h3>
                    <p>Family child care providers offer education and care for infants, toddlers and preschool-age
                        (2-5 years), and school-age (5-12 years) children in a group setting. Providers are licensed to
                        provide care in their residence (owned or rented) and can be licensed as either a:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Small Family Child Care Home-for up to 6 children (with an additional 2 school-age
                            children, under certain conditions), or</li>
                        <li>Large Family Child Care Home-for up to 12 children (with additional 2 school-age children),
                            with an assistant present.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The home is inspected for health and safety standards, and all adults living in the home must
                        obtain background and TB clearances. Family child care providers must complete 15 hours of
                        health training, including Infant/Child First Aid & CPR. While there are no minimum educational
                        units required, many family child care providers enroll in Early Childhood Education/Child
                        Development classes or hold degrees in Early Childhood Education. Parents are encouraged to
                        check on the licensing status of a particular family child care home by calling Community Care
                        Licensing at (510) 622-2602 or by going to the <a href="http://ccld.ca.gov/PG411.htm" onclick="NewWindowStnd(this.href,'doc','center');return false"
                            onfocus="this.blur()">Community Care Licensing Division website</a>.</p>
                    <p>Many family child care homes are choosing to participate in a national accreditation process
                        administered through the National Association for Family Child Care (NAFCC). The NAFCC
                        accreditation process includes the completion of a self-evaluation study designed to assist
                        family child care homes in meeting nationally recognized criteria for high quality in early
                        childhood education. For more information on NAFCC accreditation, call (202) 347-3356.</p>


                    <h3>In-Home Care</h3>
                    <p>You may hire someone (babysitter, nanny, au pair) to care for your child in your home. You set
                        the hours, responsibilities, rules and pay. In-home providers can be located through
                        nanny/employment agencies, newspaper ads, local parent magazines, etc. There is no training or
                        licensing of such caregivers, though 'nanny schools' exist in some areas. Caregivers should at
                        least receive training in Infant/Child First Aid and CPR, available through many hospitals, Red
                        Cross, etc. It is recommended that, for the safety of your child, you obtain a TrustLine
                        fingerprint clearance for the person, which is a background check through State and FBI
                        criminal records and State Child Abuse Index. Contact the TrustLine Registry for information:
                        1-800-822-8490 or <a href="http://www.trustline.org" onclick="NewWindowStnd(this.href,'doc','center');return false"
                            onfocus="this.blur()">www.trustline.org</a>. Your local child care resource and referral
                        agency (BANANAS, 4C's, or Child Care Links) may also have a listing of available in-home
                        providers.</p>

                    <h3>Relatives and Other Caregivers</h3>
                    <p>You may hire a relative or other person to provide child care either in their home or yours.
                        These arrangements can be of equal or lower cost, or free. (Note that caregivers providing care
                        to non-relative children from more than one family, other than their own, are required to be
                        licensed.) There are no State requirements for training. The recommendations above regarding
                        TrustLine clearance and First Aid/CPR training apply here. License-exempt caregivers who are
                        paid through public subsidy funds (except for grandparents, aunts and uncles) are required to
                        obtain a TrustLine background clearance.</p>

                    <h3>Community Care Licensing</h3>
                    <p>The Community Care Licensing Division is the department for the state that oversees child care
                        providers. The website has useful information for parents interested in locating child care or
                        learning more about their rights as parents. Additionally, parents can use the website for a
                        "facility search" at the following website: <a href="http://www.ccld.ca.gov/docs/ccld_search/ccld_search.aspx"
                            onclick="NewWindowStnd(this.href,'doc','center');return false" onfocus="this.blur()">http://www.ccld.ca.gov/docs/ccld_search/ccld_search.aspx</a>.
                        This search will provide the names of licensed child care centers and large family child care
                        homes, as well as the current status of the provider's license. Any unusual license status is
                        shown in red. Contact Community Care Licensing at (510) 622-2602.</p>

                        Referral agencies that can help you find a program that fits your family's needs. These
                        programs help all parents, including parents of children with special needs, navigate the
                        public and private early childhood and school age care system.</p>

                        Child Care Aware, non-profit initiative, they have developed a series of publications
                        containing important information for parents seeking child care. These resources address some
                        of the following topics:</p>

                    <h2 id="4">I need help paying for child care. What resources are available?</h2>
                    <p>In Alameda County, there are several programs to assist your family. Each type of child care
                        financial assistance has different qualifications such as income level, employment status, or
                        residency. Please check with each program to see how you may qualify. Unfortunately there are
                        often more families needing assistance than available funding.</p>
                    <h3>Alternative Payment Programs</h3>
                    <p>Alternative payment programs receive funding from the California Department of Education to
                        assist eligible parents or caregivers to pay for child care, including after-school care, for
                        children. There are eight such programs serving Alameda County. You can call any of these
                        agencies to be added to their waiting list. </p>

                    <!-- Answer #5 ***********************************************************************************************************-->

                    <h2 id="5">I need to find an after-school program for my school-aged child. Where do I start?</h2>
                    <p>The need for quality child care doesn't end once your child enters kindergarten; in fact it may
                        be more difficult to find care because there are fewer choices than for preschool. Now that
                        your child has started school, choosing a quality after-school care program can have a
                        tremendous impact on academics, self-esteem and overall happiness and adjustment. So, what type
                        of program is best for your child? Here is some information to consider when making this
                        important decision.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Programs</h3>
                    <p>School-age child care includes almost any program that regularly enrolls children from
                        kindergarten through early adolescence during the times when schools are traditionally closed
                        including non-school days during the school year and the summer. These programs may be offered
                        by schools, family day care providers, child care centers, private and public schools,
                        recreation centers and youth-serving organizations. Sometimes known as extended day programs,
                        before-and-after school programs provide enrichment, academic instruction, recreation and
                        supervised care. An array of drop-in and part-time programs also serve an ad hoc child care
                        function.</p>

                    <h3>Licensing Requirements</h3>
                    <p>The education requirement for a licensed program includes a teacher's aide or assistant who has
                        six (6) units of early childhood education. A qualified teacher is required to have at least 12
                        units of early childhood education. School age child care can be found through local child care
                        resource and referral agencies (see listing below), yellow pages, networking and newspaper ads.
                        The Community Care Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services has the
                        responsibility for licensing Child Care facilities under the authority of the California Health
                        and Safety Code and enforcing minimum standards contained in Title 22, California Code of
                        Regulations. Many school-age programs are considered "recreational" and are not required to
                        have a license. It is recommended that a prospective parent ask the program if they are
                        licensed and the educational background of their staff.</p>
                    <p>Alameda County has a variety of options for school-aged children. For more information on
                        selecting an after-school program, or for the names of programs in your area that provide
                        school-age child care contact your child's' school, your local Parks& Recreation Department or
                        one of the following Resource and Referral agencies:</p>
