			<p><strong><em>Congratulations to everyone that made this historic moment a reality!</em></strong></p>
			<p>This is the largest voter approved local investment in child care and early education in the country. With this vote Alameda County made history and helped change lives for generations to come. It proves that we are a community that is not satisfied with only some people doing well, but believes that everyone should have access to opportunities - children, families, and caregivers alike. </p>
			<p>Alameda County has shown that we understand the importance of the early years, when 90% of brain development occurs, and we've chosen to put our money where our heart is by investing in young children and the people who love and care for them. During a time of national uncertainty, we are proud that our community is leading the way in creating a fairer and more equitable society from the beginning of a child's life.</p>
			<p>We have to thank all the community members, policy makers and advocates that have given us feedback and guidance along the way. Below you can find our detailed plans for implementation and oversight.</p>
			<p>Join us as we help make child care available to more families. Sign up for updates to find out about how you can stay involved.</p>
