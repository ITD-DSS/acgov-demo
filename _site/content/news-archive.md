    		<span class="headline">County Added to State Monitoring List</span>
    		<br />
    		<span class="story">
    			Alameda County is experiencing a continued increase in reported COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, indicating elevated disease transmission. The magnitude of the change is above what would be expected as a result of the County's substantial expansion of testing, and we have been placed on the State’s County Monitoring List. Counties placed on the Monitoring List receive targeted support from the State and, after three consecutive days on the Monitoring List, are subject to State-imposed restrictions

and enforcement. To learn more about what this means for Alameda County residents and businesses, read the <a aria-label="Link to open Public Health Department website" href="http://www.acphd.org/media/591931/press-release-2020.07.12.pdf" target="_blank">press release and FAQ</a> from our Public Health Department.

<span class="headline">Update on Outdoor Dining</span>
<br />
<span class="story">
Yesterday, we learned the State issued updated guidance, dated July 9, prohibiting outdoor dining in non-variance counties, including Alameda County. While Alameda County’s Health Officer Order allowed for outdoor dining, under this stricter State guidance, all restaurants, wineries and bars in Alameda County may only be open for drive-through or pick-up/delivery options. Updated state guidance for restaurants providing takeout, drive-through, and delivery is available <a aria-label="Link to open state guidance document" href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-takeout-restaurants.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>
Our decision to permit outdoor dining was based on the Health Officer’s assessment that outdoor activities, with appropriate protective measures, carry less risk than indoor activities. At the time, many other counties had applied for a variance alongside or shortly after opening outdoor dining without consequences, and Alameda County took that same approach. At that time the State did not differentiate dining guidance by indoor/outdoor as it now does. With the new guidance dated yesterday and enforcement actions observed last week in Santa Clara County, the State is demonstrating a new approach.
<br/><br/>
We are moving toward obtaining a variance from the State, and a letter of support for a variance is on the agenda for next Tuesday’s Board of Supervisors’ meeting. Alameda County hit pause on reopening on June 29th due to rising case rates and hospitalizations, and delayed plans to apply for variance. While the data have not become more favorable, applying for a variance is a procedural action that would provide us with the flexibility to ensure that we can continue to allow the activities that the Health Officer determines are lower risk for our community. Approval of a variance is not an indication that we will pursue additional re-openings of other industries or sectors at this time. We plan to continue to make reopening decisions based on our COVID-19 indicators and data, science, and disease conditions in the County.

			<span class="headline">County-Wide Eviction Moratorium</span>
			<br />
			<span class="story">
				Our Board has enacted a County-wide moratorium on evictions beginning March 31, 2020 for 90 days if the County Public Health Emergency is still in effect. The Alameda County Board of Supervisors’ eviction moratorium ensures that all tenants, homeowners and those living in mobile home parks countywide can shelter-in-place during this crisis. This is not a rent or mortgage  strike.  You still owe your rent or mortgage. If  you  can pay  your rent  or mortgage,  you  should pay  your rent  or mortgage.
				<br><br>
				However, if you cannot pay your rent or mortgage  during this crisis, please reach out to your landlord or bank and begin discussion about your situation.  Your back rent or mortgage payments will not result in an eviction during the crisis, but your rent or mortgage payments are still an obligation that must be paid. The amended ordinance allows tenants up to 12 months to repay the overdue rent.  If you have questions, please contact our partner, ECHO Housing, at 510-581-9380. If a city has an eviction moratorium ordinance, the city ordinance can prevail to the extent the ordinance is more protective of residents.

<span class="headline">Shelter In Place Orders Extended</span>
<br />
<span class="story">
The seven Bay Area Public Health Officers who ordered a shelter in place in mid-March will extend the orders through May 31 while some restrictions are eased and tools to strengthen containment of COVID-19 are put into place. The social distancing intervention has slowed the increase of new cases and prevented the anticipated medical surge. As restrictions are eased, it is critical to ensure that growth of cases can be sufficiently contained to protect the health and safety of our community.

			<span class="headline">Order to Shelter At Home</span>
			<br />
			<span class="story">
				Alameda County joined Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties with the City of Berkeley in extending a previous stay-at-home order through May 3, 2020 in order to preserve critical hospital capacity across the region. The previous three-week order was set to expire on April 7. While the prior order has been effective in reducing the rate of transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), it is not enough. There has been a significant increase in the number of positive cases, hospitalization and deaths from COVID-19, which is beginning to strain healthcare resources.
