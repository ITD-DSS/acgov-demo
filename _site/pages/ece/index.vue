          Department of Education (CDE), California Department of Social
          Services (CDSS), Early Head Start and Head Start (EHS/HS), American
          Institutes for Research (AIR) and census data. The 2020 Zip Code

						<h2>2020 Overview of Zip Code Priorities</h2>
						<p>In order for Alameda County to be considered for expansion funding for General Child Care and State Preschool Program, the Early Care and Education Planning Council must identify the most underserved areas in our county by zip code. The priority zip codes are determined on the basis of a demand and supply analysis performed with California Department of Education (CDE), California Department of Social Services (CDSS), Early Head Start and Head Start (EHS/HS), American Institutes for Research (AIR) and census data. The 2020 Zip Code Priorities are pending approval by the County Board of Supervisors.
